# Julia programming

In this repository, you are going to find a script for the `Julia` language.
One of the benefits of this language is the programming speed, and since it is a high-level programming language, it could be said that it is easy to learn.

## Julia script

In this scenario, we are going to extract some data from a CSV file and then we are going to process it. Once the data has been processed we are going to save it into another file.

### JULIA: Working example
The particular example is the dramatic case of the outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa in 2014. This is good for our purposes, because 
1. It was clearly a very important event, so it is nice to know that learning Julia can help us understand it.
2. There is quite a lot of data on the event that is fairly easily obtainable.
3. Many of the basic things to learn about in computing can be illustrated by examples from epidemics.
